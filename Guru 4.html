Before becoming a Sikh, Amar Das followed the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism for much of his life.[3][4] One day he heard his nephew's wife, Bibi Amro, reciting a hymn by Guru Nanak, and was deeply moved by it.[3] Bibi Amro was the daughter of Guru Angad, the second and then current Guru of the Sikhs. Amar Das persuaded Bibi Amro to introduce him to her father [5] and in 1539, Amar Das, at the age of sixty, met Guru Angad and became a Sikh, devoting himself to the Guru.[6] In 1552, before his death, Guru Angad appointed Amar Das as Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of Sikhism.[7]

Guru Amar Das was an important innovator in Sikhism, who introduced a religious organization called the Manji system by appointing trained clergy, a system that expanded and survives into the contemporary era.[5][3] He wrote and compiled hymns into a Pothi (book) that ultimately helped create the Adi Granth.[8][9] Guru Amar Das helped establish the Sikh rituals relating to baby naming, wedding (Anand Karaj), and funeral,[10][11] as well as the practice of congregation and celebrations of festivals such as Diwali, Maghi and Vaisakhi.[12][13] He founded centres of Sikh pilgrimage, and picked the site for the Golden Temple.[14]

Guru Amar Das remained the leader of the Sikhs till age 95, and named his son-in-law Bhai Jetha later remembered by the name Guru Ram Das as his successor.[3][15]
