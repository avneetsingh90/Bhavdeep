    <p>
        Sikhism is one of the youngest of the major world religions and is the world's fifth largest organized religion,
        as well
        as being the world's ninth-largest overall religion. The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the
        sacred
        scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, divine unity and
        equality of
        all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all and
        honest
        conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. As of the early 21st century, there are
        about 25
        million Sikhs.
