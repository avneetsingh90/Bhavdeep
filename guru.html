    <p>
        <b> Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji</b> was the creator of <b>Sikhism</b>, and the first of the ten Sikh Guru's. The last
        Guru
        said that
        there
        would be no more Gurus after him and Sikhs would be taught by the Sikh holy book, which is called <b>Guru Granth
            Sahib Ji</b>.
        The word "Guru" means "teacher" in many Indian languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beside followers of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev is considered holy by Punjabi Hindus and Sahajdhari Sindhis across
        the
        Indian subcontinent. Because of his close connection with Hazrat Sheikh Farid-ud-din Ganj Shakar, the Punjabi
        Sufi
        saint, Nanak Dev is also considered by many Muslims to be a Sufi, or adherent of Sufic tenets.
